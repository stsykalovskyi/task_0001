>This example consists from 3 tasks.

#### Task 1
For numbers from 1 to 20:

- Print that number
- If number divides by 3, print pa instead
- If number divides by 5, print pow instead
- If number divides by both 3 and 5, print papow instead
- Put spaces in between of the elements (but not before first or after the last one).

Expected output:

```shell
1 2 pa 4 pow pa 7 8 pa pow 11 pa 13 14 papow 16 17 pa 19 pow
```

#### Task 2
Maintain the code from task v1, it's still used in the system.

Besides that, for numbers from 1 to 15:

- Print that number
- If number is even (divides by 2), print hatee instead
- If number divides by 7, print ho instead
- If number is even and divides by 7, print hateeho instead
- Put dashes in between of the elements (but not before first or after the last one).

Expected output:

```shell
1-hatee-3-hatee-5-hatee-ho-hatee-9-hatee-11-hatee-13-hateeho-15
```

As task v1 should be mainained, full expected output would be something like this:

Task v1:
```shell
1 2 pa 4 pow pa 7 8 pa pow 11 pa 13 14 papow 16 17 pa 19 pow
```
Task v2:
```shell
1-hatee-3-hatee-5-hatee-ho-hatee-9-hatee-11-hatee-13-hateeho-15
```
It would be really great if there would be no copy-and-paste (you can use copy-and-paste, just avoid duplicated code in the end result).

#### Task 3

Before or while performing this task, consider refactoring your code into OOP.

Maintain the code from task v1 and v2, as it's still used in the system.

For numbers from 1 to 10:

- Print that number
- If number is one of the numbers 1, 4, 9, print joff instead
- If number is larger than 5, print tchoff instead
- If number is one of the numbers 1, 4, 9 and is larger than 5, print jofftchoff instead
- Put dashes in between of the elements (but not before first or after the last one).

Expected output:
```shell
joff-2-3-joff-5-tchoff-tchoff-tchoff-jofftchoff-tchoff
```
As task v1 and v2 should be mainained, full expected output would be something like this:

Task v1:
```shell
1 2 pa 4 pow pa 7 8 pa pow 11 pa 13 14 papow 16 17 pa 19 pow
```
Task v2:
```shell
1-hatee-3-hatee-5-hatee-ho-hatee-9-hatee-11-hatee-13-hateeho-15
```
Task v3:
```shell
joff-2-3-joff-5-tchoff-tchoff-tchoff-jofftchoff-tchoff
```
It would be really great if there would be no copy-and-paste (you can use copy-and-paste, just avoid duplicated code in the end result).

Command to run code
```shell
